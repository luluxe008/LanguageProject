func bar: #declare a "bar" function
	add 5 #add 5 to the stack's top element
	add 22 #same as up
end main #end the "bar" function

#everything is interpret, except function (or they must be call)

:bar #call the "bar" function

add 5 #add 5 to the stack's top element
push 5 #add element at the stack's top
cp #copy the element at the stack's top


call :bar #call the "bar" function IF the stack's top element is greater than 0 or isn't a empty string

cmp 2 2 #push 1 if 2 == 2, else, it will push 0

stop #stop the program
stop 2 #stop the program with this exit code
